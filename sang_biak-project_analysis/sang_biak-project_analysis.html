			<h1>Site Intent</h1>
			<p>The intent for this project is a complete redesign of St. Matthew's Episcopal Church website. St. Mattheww's Episcopal Church is located in the East Orlando area. The current website does not pass w3c validation test. I will use pure css and html to make this website pass with w3c validator test and make it look more professional.<br />
			<br />
			I will create professional and useful global navigation link with pure css. The current website have hover effect on the nav button but it really hard to read the text. I will make the text more readable for the users. I will also need to redesign their church logo. I also need to center the page and change the color of the web page.
