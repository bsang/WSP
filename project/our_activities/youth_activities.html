				<h2>St. Matthew's Youth</h2>
				<i><strong>Our youth activities promote our values and help build lifelong friendships.</strong></i><br />
				<br />Middle School Mission Trip to<br /> Savannah
				<br />July 29 – Aug 3<br />
				<br /><p>We will join many other youth from other churches around the southeast and partner with local organizations to do things like painting houses, performing minor home repair, cleaning up debris, volunteering in community gardens or other projects that need an extra hand.  We may serve in children’s programs, elderly enters, soup kitchens, and thrift stores.  Our goal is to address the very basic needs of the residents we meet.  Savannah, Georgia is a Southern gem, filled with a unique history and character.  Savannah’s rapidly growing population has contributed to city struggles such as poverty and homelessness.<br />

<br />A typical day will have us waking up early, enjoying breakfast, devotional time, and making our lunches before heading to our worksites.  We’ll spend the day serving others and return for showers and dinner around 4p or so.  Our evenings will be spent exploring the city – an evening on River Street, an evening at 1st African Baptist Church (it was part of the Underground Railroad), a night at Tybee Island, and a Community Cookout.  Our last day will be spent splashing at Summer Waves in Jekyll on our way home.<br />

<br />Our purpose is to learn more about ourselves, our God, and to understand what “true need” is.  We will discover that even as middle schoolers, we can and do make a difference.</p>
