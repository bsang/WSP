				<h2>Adult Sunday School</h2>
				<p>We will continue our discussion group on Sunday mornings between the services through the summer.  We know we will have random groups of folks each week and so each week will stand on its own and no prior preparation will be needed.  Join us at 9:15a in the Library on Sunday mornings.  Childcare is available.</p>
				
				<h2>St. Matthew’s Young Adult Group</h2>
				<p>The young adult group, currently comprised of mostly 20-somethings both in and out of school, and mentored by Deacon Dave Somers and Frank Samuelson, is getting a makeover.<br />

<br />It occurred to us that we had become predominantly a social group.  And while fellowship with each other is an enjoyable weekly tradition, we felt that there was something more we wanted to accomplish.  Rather than becoming an inward-looking group we wanted to, cliche as it may sound, try to make the world a better place.<br />

<br />And we set out to consider what that might mean in practical terms.

And while fellowship with each other is an enjoyable weekly tradition, we felt that there was something more we wanted to accomplish.  Rather than becoming an inward-looking group we wanted to, cliche as it may sound, try to make the world a better place.<br />

<br />And we set out to consider what that might mean in practical terms.
One of our long-standing activities has been a monthly visit to Lutheran Haven, a nursing home and retirement community on Aloma Ave. not far from St. Matthew’s.  Oh, on third Mondays, we go to play games with the residents:  Bingo, Chinese Checkers, Rummikub, and Scrabble.  We play, talk, listen, and make friends.<br />

<br />So when we decided to remake ourselves, we knew that we wanted to find a way to do more for the residents of Lutheran Haven.  We decided to expand.  In addition to our 3rd Monday evening visits, we added a 1st Sunday afternoon event.  Instead of games we knit, read, and have a Spanish language club, lead by one of the residents.<br />

<br />We decided we also want to do something for the geographical community surrounding St. Matthew’s, something that would be a useful service and to raise our visibility.  To this end in Saturday, August 11, we will be hosting the first installment of a class called Cycling Savvy, free of charge, for church and community members.<br />

<br />Cycling Savvy is a multi-part course designed to help people become more confident on their bicycles, and to practice safety measures that allow them to travel stress-free nearly anywhere for transportation or leisure.  The course is for people of all skill levels, whether you got your bicycle last week, or if you have been cycling for years.  The first installment is a 3 hour classroom session which teaches the principles of safe, stress-free cycling (visit http://cyclingsavvy.org for more information on the class).<br />

<br />We feel that by encouraging safe cycling practices and improving people’s confidence in their abilities, that our neighborhood will benefit, and our community will be strengthened.  And it’s a lot of fun.<br />

<br />And that brings you up to date on our recent activities.  We are back to meeting on Monday nights 7-9 pm, and you can look up our schedule on our facebook page(http://www.facebook.com/pages/St-Matthews-Young-Adults/128997027138409 yes, we’re working on a better url!). And though we are self-titled the young adult group, we invite anyone who is interested in our activities to join us.</p>
