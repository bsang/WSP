				<h2>St. Matthew's Contemplative Corner</h2>
				<i><strong>Brought to you each month by your spiritual directors, Jan Rogers &amp; Louise Samuelson </strong></i>
				<p><br />Yesterday Rodica died. All day today my heart has been holding Karen as she is washed over by this fierce storm of loss. I cannot still this storm. None of us can. But we can stand with her in it and trust the God who can bring her peace. I received this poem in my email today. It is by Jan Richardson a gifted local writer and artist. It gave me peace and direction as I seek to stand with Karen in the days ahead. I hope it will do the same for you.<br />

<br />Peace we said, unable to stop the storm but choosing to stand within it, to still ourselves, to turn our faces toward the One who speaks peace, who breathes peace, who is peace.</p>

			<h2>Blessing in the Storm</h2>
			<p>I cannot claim<br />
to still the storm<br />
that has seized you,<br />
cannot calm<br />
the waves that wash<br />
through your soul,<br />
that break against<br />
your fierce and<br />
aching heart.<br /><br />
But I will wade<br />
into these waters,<br />
will stand with you<br />
in this storm,<br />
will say peace to you<br />
in the waves,<br />
peace to you<br />
in the winds,<br />
peace to you<br />
in every moment<br />
that finds you still<br />
within the storm.</p>
