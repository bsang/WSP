				<h2>The Summer Play Schedule</h2>
				<p>We have a jam packed summer with lots of fun activites planned for the kids and the parents!!  We will be sending out reminders via facebook (so be sure to like St Matthew’s page) and email.  If you would like to receive these updates and reminders, please be sure that you currently receive emails from Jen Latterell at jenalatterell@aol.com.  The majority of these events are free, however we have included a few days that have minimal cost involved.  We hope that you can join us for as many events as possible!  Looking forward to a FUN and EXCITING summer 2012!!</p>
				
				<h2>Armored for God</h2>
				<p>We will be stuffing boxes on July 15h at 4:30p.m. for Armored for God as part of our Mission for VBS.  We supported an organization known as KISS this year, which is Kids in Support of Soldiers.  This is an organization that sends packages to soldiers who are stationed overseas.  We are still collecting items and would appreciate your help.  We need lip balm, slim jims, pudding or fruit cups, individual drink mixes for water bottles and hard candy.  If you are able to bring in any of these items, it would be greatly appreciated.  If you know of a friend or relative who is currently serving overseas, please provide us with the APO address and we will be sure that they receive a package each month.  Thank you for your help!!</p>
